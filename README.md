# WorkFlow
We begin by taking input from the potentiometer and analyzing the range of its values. When the potentiometer value, which corresponds to the volume, falls below a certain threshold or is significantly low, the system triggers a variety of frequencies. This process is similarly applied for measuring breaths per minute (BPM). Depending on the values of BPM and volume, the servo motor adjusts its rotation accordingly to meet the required conditions. The servo motorâ€™s movement is precisely controlled based on these inputs, ensuring that it operates in alignment with the desired parameters.
